## Homework 9 ##

How long does it take to complete the training run? (hint: this session is on distributed training, so it will take a while)

**ANS:  50k step in 22 hours, 12 minutes, 10 seconds (according to Tensorboard)**


Do you think your model is fully trained? How can you tell?

**ANS: The model is getting close to being fully trained at 50K steps as its BLEU score is 0.3691 and the example with 300k steps
had a BLEU score of 0.380.**
